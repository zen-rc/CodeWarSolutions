//INSTRUCTIONS
//You're at the zoo... all the meerkats look weird. Something has gone terribly wrong - 
// someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!
// 
// Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values
// (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).
