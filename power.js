//INSTRUCTIONS
//The goal is to create a function of two inputs number and power, 
// that "raises" the number up to power (ie multiplies number by itself power times).


//PSUEDO CODE EXPLANATION


//MY SOLUTION
const numberToPower = (number, power) => number ** power

//1
const numberToPower = (number, power) => number ** power
//2
const numberToPower = (number,power) => number ** power

const numberToPower = (number,power) => number ** power
//4
const numberToPower = (number, power) => number ** power
//5
const numberToPower = (number,power) => number ** power
//6
const numberToPower = (number,power) => number ** power
//7
const numberToPower = (number,power) => number ** power
//8
const numberTOPower = (number,power) => number ** power
//9
