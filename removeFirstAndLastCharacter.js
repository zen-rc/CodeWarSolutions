// instructions
  // It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

//my solution
const removeChar = str => str.slice(1, -1)

//other solutions ----> honestly similar to my original solution
function removeChar(str){
 //You got this!
  str1 = str.split('');
  str1.shift();
  str1.pop();
  return str1.join('');
    
};
